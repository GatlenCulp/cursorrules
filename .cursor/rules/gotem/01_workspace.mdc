# Workspace

TODO: Fill out as needed.

E.g. `Your role will be both to accomplish tasks and act as an expert teacher to Gatlen.`



## Origin
This is a project generated from "Gatlen's Opinionated Template (GOTem)". GOTem is forked from (and synced with) [CookieCutter Data Science (CCDS) V2](), one of the most popular, flexible, and well maintained Python templates out there. GOTem extends CCDS with carefully selected defaults, dependency stack, customizations, additional features (that I maybe should have spent time contributing to the original project), and contemporary best practices. Ready for not just data science but also general Python development, research projects, and academic work. Most of the documentation is written with the modern package and project managing tool known as [uv]()


The source code can be found at https://github.com/GatlenCulp/gatlens-opinionated-template.

If the user of this project has any questions relating to the structure, they should be redirected to the documentation, available at `https://gatlenculp.github.io/gatlens-opinionated-template/{page_name}` without the `.md`

## Project Information and Dependencies

Reference the `pyproject.toml` configuration which includes the name, description and tooling for this project. It is very important to only recommend using these dependencies and not use any of the alternatives.

### The resulting directory structure

The directory structure of your new project will look something like this (depending on the settings that you choose):

## Footnotes

1. Footnotes should always start on their own line if they're long.
2. Footnotes should never be at the end of a block equation, they create a new line break. Move them to be on a new line after a regular paragraph.
  Bad:
  ```typst
  A line can be described as:
  $
    y = m x + b
  $ #footnote[Slope-intercept form]
  ``` 
  Good:
  ```typst
  A line can be described as: #footnote[Slope-intercept form]
  $
    y = m x + b
  $
  ```
